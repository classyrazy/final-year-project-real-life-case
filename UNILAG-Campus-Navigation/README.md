# UNILAG Campus Navigation System

## Project Overview

The **UNILAG Campus Navigation System** is a dynamic navigation tool for the University of Lagos campus. It models the campus as a graph, where buildings, gates, and intersections are nodes, and walkways or roads are edges with weights representing **distance or travel time**.  

The system uses **graph theory** and **Dijkstra's algorithm** to compute:
- The **shortest path** between any two campus locations.
- **Alternative paths** (3 different routes for each destination).
- **Dynamic path updates** (e.g., road closures or traffic changes).

The result is visualized interactively on a **Leaflet.js map** with **OpenStreetMap tiles**, making it relatable, practical, and dynamic.

## Implementation Details

### Graph Algorithm
```python

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    path = nx.dijkstra_path(graph, source=start, target=end, weight='weight')
    distance = nx.dijkstra_path_length(graph, source=start, target=end, weight='weight')
    return path, distance
```

```python
# Simulate traffic conditions
traffic_updates = [
    {"from": "Library", "to": "Sports Complex", "condition": "heavy_traffic"},
    {"from": "Main Gate", "to": "Faculty of Science", "condition": "construction"}
]
```

### Frontend Mapping
```javascript
// Initialize Leaflet map
const map = L.map('map').setView([6.5244, 3.3792], 16);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);
```
